The browser’s main functionality is to fetch the files from the server and to display them on the screen. 
It basically displays html files containing images, PDF, videos, flashes, etc in an ordered layout. A browser is a group of structured codes that performs plenty of tasks to display a webpage on the screen.
These codes are separated in to different components according to their tasks performed.
World Wide Web works on the client-server model. A user computer works as a client which 
can receive and send data to the server. When a web page is requested by a user, the browser contacts the requested
server (where the website is stored) and by fetching and interpreting the requested files, 
it displays the web page on the computer screen.
The whole process takes place in these three steps:
1.      Contact to DNS Server - When a user enters a URL into the address bar and hits ‘enter’, at first browser contacts the DNS server. A DNS server stores the IP addresses of the server associated with the corresponding domain names. The DNS server takes the domain name from the browser and returns the corresponding IP address to the browser.
2.      Contact to Server – After getting the IP address of the server for the requested webpage, browser sends a request to that server for the desired files.
